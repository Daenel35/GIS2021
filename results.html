                      All models are a reasonable simplification of the reality, which often represent rather complex convergence of natural phenomena. To model landslide susceptibility several assumptions and simplifications are taken regarding the environmental factors like slope, land curvature, plan, and aspect (orientation of slope), vegetation, land cover and use, lithology, geological faults, water bodies, landslides inventories, among others. Further assumptions regarding the processing of data and algorithms applied are also commonly made to reach an output. To assess the quality of the results validation techniques are applied, usually involving dividing the input dataset into two groups, one for training the model and the other for validating the output obtained. Performance in this case is evaluated through Overall Accuracy, depicting the percentage of the testing dataset correctly predicted as either a landslide-susceptible or not a landslide-susceptible area.

In this section the different approaches used and their associated results will be shown, starting from the 1K - 1000 points approach explanation to continue with the 5K - 5000 points approach.

                  This project has shown interesting results in the implementation of a Machine Learning Approach by using satellite images derived geospatial data in order to determine the Landslide and Non-Landslide zones of the Tirano Region.
                  The use of a GIS approach to determine the proposed objective was important considering that it would help policy makers to get information by an indirect method which has huge advantages in terms of costs and velocity of the processing.
